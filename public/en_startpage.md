# Expoll - Polling made easy

## Why expoll

Expoll is a voting website similar to [doodle](https://doodle.com) or [votesup](https://votesup.eu). We tried to combine both in a neat small and easy-to-use website. Unlike doodle, who deletes polls after a quite short time, or votesup where you have to be logged in with an active session to even get the chance to vote for something withing a few minutes, we are trying to keep every vote possible (though probably have to restrict the creation of polls to about 5-10 per user at a time in the future).

## Features

The pages language changes automatically between german and english to best suit the browsers preferences. With expoll you are able to participate in as much polls as you like and create and maintain up to 10 polls at a time. When creating a new poll you can choose between a word poll and a date or date-time poll to suit best your usecase. Date (and date-time) polls have even the possibility to define a start and an end time.

## How to create a user and login

To participate in any poll you first have to sign up. To get to the signup page you can use the button in the top right corner of your screen. Over there you have to provide your "real" (as real as you like) a username and your mail address (unlike the name this should be correspond to a real address you have access to). It's important that you type the correct mail address because after creating a user you are automatically logged in, but to login on another browser you will have to provide your mail address and you will receive a login link to allow easy and password-less access to your polls.
