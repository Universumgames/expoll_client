## What's the purpose of this?
Expoll is a voting website similar to other woll-known voting/polling websites. We tried to combine both in a neat small
and easy-to-use website. Unlike the well-known platforms, who delete polls after a quite short time, or where you have
to be logged in with an active session to even get the chance to vote for something withing a few minutes, we are trying
to keep every vote possible (though probably have to restrict the creation of polls to about 5-10 per user at a time in
the future).

## First steps
Easily login via Sign in with Apple or Google. 
If you don't want to login this way you can choose to login via email. 
You don't need a password, each time you try to login, a one-time-password will be sent via E-Mail.

After logging in you can create a new poll or participate in existing ones.
Just invite your friends to participate in your poll by sending them the link to your poll.

## Pricing
All features are completely free to use. 
We don't have any ads so we would appreciate if you would support us via the in-app purchases or via [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/universum).
All earnings help us to keep the servers running and to develop new features.
Though important to mention: Currently you are only able to create up to 10 polls, but you can join as many as you like.

## Something is not working
If you have any problems with the website or the iOS App, please report a bug via this handy [website](https://universegame.de/bug?app=expoll).
